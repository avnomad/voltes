This repository hosts a cluster of 16 closely related projects, each in its own 
branch. One should be able to checkout and build any of them.

They were all created during May 2009 and related to an exercise a professor 
(Konstantinos F. Sagonas) set on his programming languages course and I heard 
from a fellow student.

1 visualizes the input using OpenGL to assist debugging.
13 implement different algorithms/(hand) optimizations and solve multiple 
    instances of the problem noting their execution time to assess the 
    effectiveness of these algorithms/optimizations.
2 conform to the input/output requirements of the exercise and were e-mailed to 
    the professor.
